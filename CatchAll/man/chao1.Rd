\title{Chao1 species richness estimator}
\usage{
chao1(input_data, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_data}{An input type that can be processed by \code{convert()} or a \code{phyloseq} object}

\item{output}{Deprecated; only for backwards compatibility}

\item{answers}{Deprecated; only for backwards compatibility}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{alpha_estimate}, or \code{alpha_estimates} for \code{phyloseq} objects
}
\description{
This function implements the Chao1 richness estimate, which is often
mistakenly referred to as an index.
}
\note{
The authors of this package strongly discourage the use of this
estimator.  It is only valid when you wish to assume that every taxa has
equal probability of being observed. You don't really think that's possible,
do you?
