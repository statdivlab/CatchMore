# CatchMore <img src="docs/catchmore.png" align="right" width="165px"/>



CatchMore is an R package to estimate species richness with mixed-Poisson and non-mixed-Poisson models. It extends the historically popular methodology CatchAll to include a more diverse catalogue of models, and provides an easy-to-use R implementation that runs on Unix machines (unlike CatchAll). 

CatchMore is written by [Kendrick Qijin Li](http://students.washington.edu/qijunl2/) and [Amy Willis](http://statisticaldiversitylab.com/team/amy-willis), and is maintained by the [Statistical Diversity Lab](http://statisticaldiversitylab.com/) at the University of Washington. 



## Installation ##


```r
devtools::install_github("statdivlab/CatchMore")
library(CatchMore)
```

## Basic Usage ##

Let's illustrate CatchMore using the `apples` dataset from the `breakaway` package

```r
library(breakaway)
data(apples)
```

CatchMore can run a number of different exponential-mixed Poisson models, including the Poisson model (a zero-exponential mixture), the geometric model (a single exponential-mixed Poisson model), and two- or three-component exponential mixture:

```r
Poisson_model(apples, cutoff = 20)
geometric_model(apples, cutoff = 20)
two_geometric_model(apples, cutoff = 50)
three_geometric_model(apples, cutoff = 70)
```

To pick between them, we implemented `catch_all`, which produces the same results as legacy CatchAll, and our new model selection procedure `catch_more`:

```r 
catch_all(apples)
catch_more(apples)
```
